Current works
-------------------
  * update ui in doc (readme, dependencies, screenshots, gstarted, ...)
  * embed R in ui (tab, etc.)
  * remove classes Survivals*
  * remove classes *Copula
  * remove MSVC support (vcproj, src/win32, doc)
  * interest interpolation: linear -> cubic
  * remove antitethical option? (SimulationThread::uvalues)
  * review functional tests (because --trace removed)
  * segment indexes as unsigned short
  * rating indexes as unsigned char
  * sector indexes as unsigned char
  * unify ccruncher main (gsl_error_handler, ccruncher-gui, ccruncher-cmd, etc.)

Future works
-------------------
  * technical features
     - input file in binary format
     - allow evaluation in multiple time horizons
     - allow to aggregators to append data to file
     - add configuration file to ccruncher-gui
     - add menu to ccruncher-gui
  * improve model
     - add grouped t-copula support
     - risk dissagregation (eg. ES) along segments ('Introduction to Credit Risk Modeling')
     - consider that a obligor could belong to a weighted sum of sectors
  * improve functional tests
     - examples based on real data
     - do test04.xml but using t-copula (see 2.54+2.65 in 'Introduction to Credit Risk Modeling')
