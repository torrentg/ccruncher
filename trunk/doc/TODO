CCRUNCHER TODO
==============

Current works
-------------------
  * determine the degrees-of-freedom of t-student copula based on historical data
  * add stochastic exposure

Future works
-------------------
  * in 'values' tag allow express date as interval from starting 
    date (eg. 1D, 2M, 3Y) instead of a fixed date (eg. 03/01/2011).
  * add risk aggregation to documentation
     - explain how to distribute the risk (eg. ES) along segments
     - see 'introduction to credit risk modeling'
  * improve functional tests
     - examples based on real data
     - improve documentation adding tests section
  * beautify html printing output
  * allow evaluation in multiple time horizons
      <breaks>
        <break name="T25Y" at="25Y" method="exp">
          <segmentations>
            ..
          </segmentations>
        </break>
      </breaks>
  * allow ratings evaluated to date previous to T0
  * add obligor-obligor dependences
  * graphic interface
  * considere that a obligor could belong to a few different sectors
  * explain how to determine the minimum number of simulations required
  * improve lookup-table when survival values are low
  * in techdoc add cholesky decomposition detail
  * address the issue of curse of dimensionality
