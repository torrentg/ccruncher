CCRUNCHER TODO
==============

Current works
-------------------
  * case studies
  * support Li model (survivals as exponential distr.)
  * estimate copula params using MLE
  * add attribute 'type' in mcorrels tag

Future works
-------------------
  * graphic interface
  * input file in binary format
  * add risk aggregation to documentation
     - explain how to distribute the risk (eg. ES) along segments
     - see 'introduction to credit risk modeling'
  * improve functional tests
     - examples based on real data
     - improve documentation adding tests section
  * allow evaluation in multiple time horizons

  * considere that a obligor could belong to a few different sectors
  * explain how to determine the minimum number of simulations required
