    abstract = {{This article studies the problem of default correlation. It introduces a random variable called  ” time-until-default” to denote the survival time of each defaultable entity or financial instrument, and defines the default correlation between two credit risks as the correlation coefficient between their survival times. The author explains why a copula function approach should be used to specify the joint distribution of survival times after marginal distributions of survival times are derived from market information, such as risky bond prices or asset swap spreads. He shows that the current approach to default correlation through asset correlation is equivalent to using a normal copula function. Numerical examples illustrate the use of copula functions in the valuation of some credit derivatives, such as credit default swaps and first-to-default contracts.}},

    abstract = {{In today's increasingly competitive financial world, successful risk management, portfolio management, and financial structuring demand more than up-to-date financial know-how. They also call for quantitative expertise, including the ability to effectively apply mathematical modeling tools and techniques.  An Introduction to Credit Risk Modeling supplies both the bricks and the mortar of risk management. In a gentle and concise lecture-note style, it introduces the fundamentals of credit risk management, provides a broad treatment of the related modeling theory and methods, and explores their application to credit portfolio securitization, credit risk in a trading portfolio, and credit derivatives risk. The presentation is thorough but refreshingly accessible, foregoing unnecessary technical details yet remaining mathematically precise.  Whether you are a risk manager looking for a more quantitative approach to credit risk or you are planning a move from the academic arena to a career in professional credit risk management, An Introduction to Credit Risk Modeling is the book you've been looking for. It will bring you quickly up to speed with information needed to resolve the questions and quandaries encountered in practice.}},
