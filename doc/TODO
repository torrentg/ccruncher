CCRUNCHER TODO
==============

Current works
-------------------
  * update ui in doc (readme, dependencies, screenshots, gstarted, ...)
  * review functional tests (because --trace removed)
  * bulk output to file ?
  * add configuration file to ccruncher-gui
  * interest at t=0 can be distinct than 0
  * use spline in interest curve

Future works
-------------------
  * technical features
     - input file in binary format
     - add file hash (CRC32 - see zlib library)
  * improve model
     - add grouped t-copula support
     - allow evaluation in multiple time horizons
     - risk dissagregation (eg. ES) along segments ('Introduction to Credit Risk Modeling')
     - consider that a obligor could belong to a weighted sum of sectors
  * improve functional tests
     - examples based on real data
     - do test04.xml but using t-copula (see 2.54+2.65 in 'Introduction to Credit Risk Modeling')
