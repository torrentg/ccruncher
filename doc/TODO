CCRUNCHER TODO
==============

Current works
-------------------

  * performance tip: loop obligor-simulations instead of simulation-obligors
  * check for unused segments (in Aggregator class?)

Future works
-------------------
  * technical features
     - input file in binary format
     - move to Qt5
     - multi-currency support or expression evaluator
       <values t="01/07/2015" exposure="2960.0" recovery="60%" currency="dolars"/>
       <values t="01/07/2015" exposure="2960.0*$DOLAR_EURO" recovery="60%" />
     - allow equal number of sims by thread
  * improve documentation
     - add architecture diagrams
  * improve model
     - add grouped t-copula support
     - allow evaluation in multiple time horizons
     - risk dissagregation (eg. ES) along segments ('Introduction to Credit Risk Modeling')
     - consider that a obligor could belong to a weighted sum of factors
  * improve functional tests
     - examples based on real data
     - do test04.xml but using t-copula (see 2.54+2.65 in 'Introduction to Credit Risk Modeling')
