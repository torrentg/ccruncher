CCRUNCHER TODO
==============

Current works
-------------------
  * multi-factor model support

Future works
-------------------
  * technical features
     - graphic interface
     - input file in binary format
     - allow evaluation in multiple time horizons
     - remove gzip support (replaced by pipes support)
  * improve model
     - add grouped t-copula support
     - risk dissagregation (eg. ES) along segments ('Introduction to Credit Risk Modeling')
     - considere that a obligor could belong to a few different sectors
     - how to determine the minimum number of simulations required?
  * improve functional tests
     - examples based on real data
     - improve documentation adding tests section
     - do test04.xml but using t-copula (see 2.54+2.65 in 'Introduction to Credit Risk Modeling')
