CCRUNCHER TODO
==============

Current works
-------------------
  * stock/asset/index case
  * mention to Gibbs sampler?
  * create F() and Finv(t()) output
  * equal spline type in F() and Finv(t())
  * try the new parallelization algorithm (openmp)
  * review class Interest
  * Timer: start_time + total convert from double -> timeval
          use clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) instead of gettimeofday()
          see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6498972/faster-equivalent-of-gettimeofday
  * append test (Asset::prepare, Portfolio - unused segmentations, asset values, etc. -)

Future works
-------------------
  * investigate how correlation depends on time
  * technical features
     - move to Qt5
     - input file in binary format
     - force equal number of sims by thread
     - PD functions can mix transition matrix and dprobs
  * improve model
     - add grouped t-copula support
     - consider that an obligor could belong to a weighted sum of factors
  * improve functional tests
     - examples based on real data
