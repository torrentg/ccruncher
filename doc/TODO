CCRUNCHER TODO
==============

Current works
-------------------
  * market model equivalence
  * change pdf doc title?
  * open ccbinf code to public
  * VaR and ES are asymptotically normal

Future works
-------------------
  * technical features
     - src subdirs: engine, readers, writers, utils
     - create ccbinf-gui version
     - add risk uncertainty in ccruncher-gui
     - add portfolio optimization in ccruncher-gui
     - isolate xml/binary parser code
     - isolate aggregators code
     - create F() and Finv(t()) output
     - support for input file in binary format
     - force equal number of sims by thread
     - simultaneous transition matrix and dprobs in input file
     - add support for json and yaml input files
  * underlying model
     - investigate how correlation depends on time
     - compute stderr using resampling techniques
     - add grouped t-copula support
     - an obligor could belong to a weighted sum of factors
     - multi-level factors (eg. countries-sectors)
  * others
     - test ccruncher-cmd in xeon-phi architecture
     - examples based on real data
