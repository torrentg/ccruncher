    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <div class="gray-box">
      1. Why this project name ?
    </div>
    <p>
      CCruncher calculates the credit portfolio risk valuation with intensive numerical 
      computation. These kind of programs are called number crunchers.
      The mix between the terms 'credit' and 'number cruncher' generates 
      the name 'credit cruncher'. CCruncher is not related to the recent 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credit_crunch">credit crunch</a>, but is
      a tool that can aid to control the risks involved in this crisis.
    </p>

    <div class="gray-box">
      2. Why this logo ?
    </div>
    <p>
      The CCruncher logo is based on a sculpture by 
      <a href="http://www.robertllimos.es">Robert Llim√≥s</a>,
      a catalan artist. The original work is named 
      <a href="http://www.robertllimos.es/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=88&amp;Itemid=583&amp;lang=en&amp;vsig1_0=16">Threshold</a> 
      and is located in Atlanta. It has a twin version named 
      <a href="http://www.robertllimos.es/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=88&amp;Itemid=583&amp;lang=en&amp;vsig1_0=17">Marc</a> 
      that is located in Barcelona. The sculpture has a powerful symbolic charge that can be 
      interpreted in many ways.
    </p>

    <div class="gray-box">
      3. What is the project's maturity ?
    </div>
    <p>
      ccruncher-2.2 is a stable version. If you have any bug or suggestion to report, 
      please send an email to <a href="mailto:gtorrent@ccruncher.net">ccruncher team</a>
      or post it to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ccruncher/">SourceForge</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="gray-box">
      4. Is there a company that provides support for CCruncher ?
    </div>
    <p>
      Yes. <a href="http://www.tatine.es">Tatine.es</a> provides consulting services for the 
      analysis of SME loan portfolios using CCruncher. It also provides support services such as integration, 
      maintenance and ad-hoc development related to CCruncher.
    </p>
    
    <div class="gray-box">
      5. What about performance ?
    </div>
    <p>
      CCruncher is designed to be extremely fast. When they are <i>10</i> obligors
      it computes <i>1000000</i> simulations in few seconds. When obligors are
      <i>50000</i> it takes few minutes to do the same task.
      CCruncher execution time depends on multiple factors: machine (processor, L1/L2 caches, cores, etc.),
      number of simulations, number of obligors, number of ratings, number of factors, number of segmentations,
      and number of assets. 
    </p>
    
    <div class="gray-box">
      6. Why can the input files be gzipped (*.gz) but not zipped (<span style="text-decoration:line-through">*.zip</span>) ?
    </div>
    <p>
      The zip algorithm is covered by patents, but gzip is not; furthermore gzip is open
      source. You can download a gzip tool for windows from
      <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/">7-zip</a>. UNIX environments
      have the gzip/gunzip commands out of the box. You can read more at the <a href="http://www.gzip.org/">gzip website</a>.
    </p>

    <div class="gray-box">
      7. Can an obligor belong to a weighted sum of factors ?
    </div>
    <p>
      Currently not. CCruncher was designed to work with portfolios of SMEs. 
      Usually, in these portfolios each obligor belongs to a single sector/factor. 
      We can add this feature if there are several people who request it.
    </p>

    <div class="gray-box">
      8. I don't have the transition matrix. What can I do ?
    </div>
    <p>
      You can assume that the default probability over time for each rating is an
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential distribution</a>.
      In this case set all the transition matrix values to <i>0</i> except the diagonal
      values, that contains the probability of non-default, <i>(1-p<sub>r</sub>)</i>, 
      and the 'default' column values that contains the probability of default, 
      <i>p<sub>r</sub></i>.
    </p>

    <div class="gray-box">
      9. Some samples exhibits strange behavior. What is happening ?
    </div>
    <p>
      1) Standard Error of VaR increase when the number of simulations increases:
      We use the Maritz-Jarret to obtain these values. To reduce the computational 
      cost we truncate the involved sum. In some cases, this action causes the 
      observed behavior.<br/>
      2) VaR plot has jumps: This happens because the resulting portfolio loss 
      distribution is discrete with a support composed of few values.
    </p>
